  <P>Amanda G Lentz (1810PA-1862IN) & the Reverend John FLORA
(1800GER-1876IN) started their family in Harrison County, Indiana.
Results were seven known children born; Josephine F, (1833IN-19xxKS),
Volney Pulaski, (1834IN-1909KS), Sarah Catharine, (1836IN-186x??),
Daniel Rice Boon, (1838IN-1908CO). Margaret Ann, (1841IN-1926MO),
Maryetta Isebell (1843IN-184xIN) (assumed, died early), and lastly 	<a href="http://wc.rootsweb.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=califia1&id=I1698">John
Andrew</a> (1845IN-1934KS).




 <br><br><center>                   <>-------<>-------<>		 </center>


    <P>JOHN ANDREW FLORA (1845IN-1934KS), my great-grandfather who as
I, my mother and my grandfather, was baby of his family, born 5
September 1845, ventured at 21 y/o from Lyon County, Kansas with 
teenage bride Mary Elizabeth Shults and 29 y/o brother Daniel Rice Boon FLORA
with Captain Jacob Hendrick Conrad, 32 y/o and his 21 y/o brother Henry
Wilford Conrad, all but Mary, born Harrison County, Indiana, at least
three were documented students of United Brethren's, Indiana Hartsville
University, noted several places as being earliest of settlers in Osage
Indian Ceded Lands, when opened in 1867 by our government for
settlement, one mile southeast of "Brown's ford", east bank of 
Verdigris River, near Drum Creek, on 165 acre first purchased from Osage Indian's
then in 1870 from our government, "Prairie Valley Farm", also once
Verdigris City where in 1869 governor named as county seat of newly
created (3 June 1869) Montgomery County, located near McTaggart's mill built 
eight years later in what in January 1871, became Liberty Township, Montgomery County, Kansas.

   <P>"...first white child born in Montgomery County." (so Cutler
wrote in 1883), was John Andrew FLORA and Mary Elizabeth Shults',
daughter, Harriette Amanda FLORA, 17 September 1869, --- who 68 years
later was: "American Mother of 1937", first women with national radio
Bible Class, wife to vice-chairman of Union Pacific Railroad Company,
with two of three sons in Volume 27 & 29 of "Who's Who in America".
Daniel returned to Lyon County, 27 December 1868 marrying Mary
Holingsworth, sister of older brother V P (Volney Pulaski) FLORA's 
wife,
who also after 1870 census, moved family, pre-1875, to Liberty 
Township.
Their Indiana first born daughter, Wilhelmina Isidora, on 28 November
1875 became Henry W Conrad's wife, later mother of their three 
daughters
raised in Montgomery County, Kansas.



     <P>John Andrew was the baby of his family, born Friday, 5
September 1845 in New Market (Mauckport after 1847), Harrison County,
Indiana, to John FLORA and Amanda Lentz. About 1857, family moved to
Hartsville, Bartholomew County, Indiana where he attended college. Then
following father joining Union army, 20 August 1861 and mother dying,
January 1862, 16+ y/o John removed to Kansas (possibly with 23+ y/o
brother Daniel in 1862). The three Indiana born FLORA brothers fought
part of the Civil War in Kansas during October1864. John is found at
Fremont Township, Lyon County with brother V P in 1865 state census,
then on Sunday, 10 February 1867, at Lyon County, Kansas, by Minister 
of the Gospel, S G Elliott, was married to MARY ELIZABETH SHULTS
(1851OH-1874KS), born Friday, 20 June 1851 in Franklin County, Ohio.
They had four known children, three surviving to adulthood born
Montgomery County. Mary crossed over the river at age 23, on Monday, 9
November 1874 with daughter Harriette in her bed comforting her, buried
in Americus Cemetery, Lyon County with one month old daughter Jennie G.
John is alone on state census of March 1875 in Liberty Township,
Montgomery County. Children being raised by grandmother Shults in
Montgomery County where her obit said she moved in 1871, and in 1880
census. John was married by F R Morton, to widow Adda Smith
(1844IN-1913KS) 24 October 1878, with two of her three children
surviving, moving family to Oswego, Labette (Dorn till 1864, Neosho 
till 7 February1867) County. Addie passed away January 1913, John, November
1934, both buried in Oswego Cemetery with, we believe, her older 
sister, the Shipley's Lot 31, Block5.

    <P> John attended Hartsville University, as earlier did at least
one sister, Margaret Ann and 1870 neighbors, Hendrix & Henry Conrad.
John in 1859 and 1861 (school building burnt in 1860).

  <P>Mary Ellen of Bartholomew County Clerk's office wrote;

  <P>(8/05/05): "At Hartsville College there was Rev Wm Fix [married Mahala
Mobley, 28 May 1848, sister of Sarah & Lewis], Rev I Muth, Professor L
Mobley [married Julia Anna Rhorer], but no Flora as a teacher or as a
graduate....no listing of students...They moved to Huntington [Indiana] in 1897."

  <P>"Currently [2005] they are taking the Mobley Curves out of road 46 west
of Hartsville....many wrecks but very scenic."

  <P>Director of United Brethren Historical Center, Randy Neuman reported:

  <P>(8/10/05): "I also can confirm that John Andrew Flora attended
Hartsville University. I was able to find his name in one of the 
account books for 1859 and 1861."

  <P>(8/17/05): "This is the second Hartsville College building (see photo).
The first one was destroyed around 1860. I think it burned in a fire. I
have never found a picture of the original building. The second 
building was constructed during 1860-1865. This is the photograph commonly used
when talking about Hartsville. This building burned in 1898."


    <P> John A was at home for 1860 census for Haw Creek Township,
Bartholomew County, next door is sister Sarah Catherine with Henry K
Muth and their two children, William, 1 y/o and two month old Homer R 
E. A County Clerk's document dated September 1862 states; John (62),
Daniel(23) & John (17) were in 6th Regiment Indiana Infantry 
Volunteers, National Archives list ONLY the father, 20 August 1861 to 14
February1863. William G Cutler's 1883 history said of John Andrew; " On
9 April 1862 [age, 16-1/2] he emigrated to Kansas, ..." (?), Nelson
Case's 1901 history also says1862. John, his brother "V P" (Volney
Pulaski) with 300 others from Lyon County, served in Kansas State
Militia October 1864 at area which Zebulon M Pike crossed future state
line in 1806 determining lands included in $15M 1803 Louisiana 
Purchase. He discovered Pikes Peak that November. John appears on all later 
Kansas census until 4 November 1934 death.

  <P>CIVIL WAR: John Andrew, at age 19, is documented enlisting Friday, 14
October 1864 at Emporia, Lyon County, Kansas (State under Martial Law)
with Captain F H Hunt in Company F, 11th Regiment Kansas State Militia
under Colonel A J Mitchell, brother "V P" (Volney Pulaski, who had
arrived in Kansas Territory fall 1860), on 25 April, both on "PAY ROLL"
14 October to 16 November1864. Both were issued a horse and rigging.
Active duty shown as, 9 October to 29 October 1864, between Coldwater
Grove (13-miles south of Aubrey) and Fort Scott, KS. They were involved
with defeat of General Sterling Price's Missouri & Kansas campaign
noted, 13 November 1864 entry of Virginia Davis GRAY'S, diary, 
published in 1983 "Arkansas Historical Quarterly". They were attached, at
Coldwater Grove, to Colonel Thomas Moonlight's, 2nd Brigade of Major
General Blunt's Provisional Cavalry Division. This 2nd brigade included
the 11th Kansas Cavalry, Moonlight's Regiment., 2 Companies of 5th
Kansas Cavalry, 2 Companies of 16th Kansas Cavalry, a battery of
howitzers and the 11th Regiment Cavalry, Kansas State Militia (under
Colonel A.J. Mitchell). with assignment to go to Fort Scott, along the
Ft Leavenworth to Ft Scott, 1859 road (generally, present day route #7)
from Paola. They engaged General Price's 12-mile caravan, saving Mound
City, 6:00 am, 25 October 1864 while "Mine Creek" engagement occurred
later (11:30 am, 25 October1864) in Linn County, KS. They continued
towards Fort Scott, again engaged at 2:30 pm at Little Osage River, 
near Fort Lincoln, with Price continuing out of state at Deerfield, 
Missouri, 10:30 pm and on "56-miles" to my home town of Carthage Missouri(ah)
which had earlier been burnt down, for forage at Spring River. The 
three FLORA brothers were each battling in Linn County, Kansas, 24-26 October
1864! No pension was found for John Andrew. (SOURCES: Kansas State
Historical Society, microfilm reel # 817, p 89, 11th KSM, Muster Rolls,
Records of KS Adj Gen. & Arnold Schofield, "Mine Creek" site manager)

    <P> Therefore, William G Cutler's 1883 
<a href="http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/labette/labette-co-p15.html">biography</a> is in
error with "Company C", and "Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Infantry", BUT,
<a href="http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/labette/1901/f/floraja.shtml">Judge Nelson Cases's</a> 
is found completely incorrect, as are other items within his biography, ie; middle name WAS Andrew, NOT Alexander!

   <P>  John, # 33 on roster, age "38", is of record "30 June 1883",
being in Oswego GAR Post #150, occupation; "hotel keeper", a former
"Sargt."(?), discharged; "15 January 1865"(?), ---dropped in 1891 for
lack of dues payment while serving as Labette County Register of Deeds,
1890-1892.

    <P> We've been advised by officials of Labette County Kansas, that
they will now establish a Civil War Marker for John Andrew FLORA and so
honor him each Memorial Day, henceforth.

    <P> Back to John's first wife, Mary Elizabeth Shults, was fourth
known child of Elijah Schultz (1824OH-1860KS) and Harriette Catherine
Sterling (1824NY-1905KS), whom Carl Gray traced as great,granddaughter
of Colonel Heinrich Staring (1730-1818) of Tryon County New York's
Militia during Revolutionary War, --- and Schultz family with seven
children, possibly other family members (see Elmendaro Township, Lyon
County 1870 census), left Washington Township, Franklin County, Ohio
settling in Emporia Township, Breckenridge (Lyon, 6 February1862)
County, Kansas Territory 1859. Harriette, widowed, 26 September 1860
while pregnant with their eighth child, Henry, married widower John
"March" (Marsh), 18 November 1868, is found in1870 census of Elmendaro
Township, Lyon County, Kansas (P O Neosho Rapids), with kids and
realitives split in neighboring households. Strangeis fact ---- Marsh,
or marriage is never found mentioned again with her name returned to
Shults.

   <P>  Brother Daniel Rice Boon FLORA & wife Mary lived next to John &
Mary Elizabeth in 1870 census, while the county's population exploded
from a few white settlers in 1867 to 7,564, growing rapidly to 13,017 
in 1875, 18,213 in 1880 and 36,252 in 2000. D R B FLORA with neighbors,
Conrads, are noted in historical writings being in area in 1868.

   <P>  The Ingall's, of now famous 
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/1867/indpic.html">"Little House on the Prairie"</a> fame, settled just west, on Diminished Reserves of Osage Indians remaining about a
year, where little Carrie Ingall was born August 1870.

   <P>  During those early years, amongst the many other hardships, were:
130 Kansas settlers slaughtered by Indians in 1867, a horrendous 
prairie fire occurred in 1868 when the night sky was said to be bright enough 
to read a book one-mile away but, as pioneers. The FLORA families survived
most hardships of early prairie living, then John returned to Lyon
County for awhile, back to Montgomery then to Labette, Daniel to
Colorado Territory. Volney's daughter married in Montgomery County and
stayed. John's mother-in-law, Harriette Shults, no doubt raised the 
kids until John got settled after Mary's death and with her children's
families are in Montgomery County 1880 census, since 1871 with my
grandfather William FLORA in her household since three y/o to early
manhood.

     <P>Following five excerpts are from 
<a href="http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/montgomery/montgomery-co-p1.html">Cutler's</a> 1883 writings, flavor conditions found when John & Mary FLORA 
settled to raise their family.

  <P>"[also]- About six miles south of where Independence now stands, on the
west [right] bank of the Verdigris River, was the site of [Indian
Village] Big Hill, or Gov. Joe's village."

  <P>"Although numerous settlements had already been made, yet it was not
until 1869, that the resistless march of emigration first crossed the
Verdigris River to occupy and possess the "promised land" that lay
beyond.

  <P>"The Government agency was located near the mouth of Drum Creek
[Dunlap's store & Montgomery City later nearby before moving to
Independence in 1872], on its north side, and was held by ....... in
1868 by Maj. I. N. Gibson, a Quaker gentleman, who was held in high
esteem by both the whites and Indians. This general respect he retained
throughout the adjustment of the serious difficulties between the races
in 1869 and 1870, occasioned by the unauthorized attempts of settlers
[such as the Ingall's] to trespass upon and occupy these lands, the
rightful property of the Indian."

  <P>"No improvements of importance had yet been made, so that up to 1869
there were but few [including two FLORA families] and scattered
evidences of anything except Indian occupancy. In the midst of such
surroundings of uncivilized life, the hardy pioneer of Montgomery 
County had come to make his home, enduring the trials, braving the dangers,
expecting the rewards. In order that a settler should obtain and occupy
a "squatter's claim," at this time he was obliged to secure consent 
from the Indians, which was easily done by paying them a few dollars in
money."

  <P>"During the winter of 1869, the banks of the Verdigris [river] were
alive with camps and campers. Families spent the winter, living in
covered wagons or in huts constructed of hay."

  <P>ALSO NOTE:
<i><a href="http://skyways.lib.ks.us/counties/MG/"> Kansas: a Cyclopedia Of State
History</a></i>, by Frank Blackmar (1912).)

  <P>"An election for county officers and to
locate the county seat was held in November of the same year [1869]. 
The returns from Drum Creek were thrown out on technical grounds, and the
remaining vote gave a majority for Liberty. ....

  <P>"They [a new board] selected Independence as the county seat and, finding it useless to dissent, the
old board gave up the fight. At a hotly contested election in Nov.,
1870, Independence received the largest number of votes and became the
permanent county seat."

  <P>"The organization of county government was followed by reckless and
extravagant bond issues. Before 1872 the people had for various 
purposes voted a debt upon themselves to the amount of nearly $1,000,000."

  <P>AND FURTHER NOTE:"On the 11th of September [six days before Harriette
FLORA's birth in 1869], the founders of the town [Independence, Kansas]
and their friends thought to initiate the place, marking the event as
historic by a season of rejoicing. The feast consisted of roast ox, a
whole barrel of bread, and four kegs of beer. The party brought these
items from Oswego by wagon and ox-team, with <a href="http://www.indkschamber.org/independence_history.htm">J.N. Debrule</a> as teamster."</a>

  <P>            ------------

  <P><a href="http://www.lasr.net/pages/city.php?City_ID=KS0611012">"Legend has it that Independence</a> [Kansas], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, had more millionaires per capita than any place else in
the United states. Standing as testimony to that legend are the stately
mansions still scattered throughout the city."


   <P>  The above debt, political unrest in Montgomery County and
1873/4 national financial crisis or 1874 "grasshopper infestation" are
all possible reasons why John and Mary FLORA may have returned to Lyon
County, if in-deed they did, some 100-miles northerly, --- my guess,
after1872, likely summer of 1873 or '74. Date of 1872 allows for 
FLORA's five years, required by Homestead Act, to improve their claimed land 
for ownership, but in the mean time, son Clarence Morton was born 22 April
1868, then Harriette Amanda (Hattie A) 17 September 1869 (said by Wm
Cutler, to be "...first white child born in Montgomery County." --- so
what about Clarence's birth, when it was Wilson County????), then
William Walter, 23 November 1871), lastly (?) where was Jennie G born,
living 1-month, whose birth may have caused Mary's, 9 November 1874
death.

   <P>  The ninth Federal census in 1870 of Verdigris Township
(Liberty, January 1871), Montgomery (1864 till 3 June 1869, Wilson)
County, Kansas lists John with wife Mary E., son C M, 2, daughterH O,
9/12m, and two farm hands, R Marsh (?possibly, wife's step-brother),
dwelling #188, family #187 located between household's of brother 
Daniel with wife Mary, dwelling #187, family #186 and dwelling #189, family
#188, being <a hrrg="http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/montgomery/montgomery-co-p17.html">Hendrix (Capt J H ) Conrad</a>, who also attended, in 1856, Hartsville University, Bartholomew County,
Indiana and mined in Nevada, 1859-1863, with a son, Hoarce Greely
(Harriette's age) & brother <a href="http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/c3/conrad_henry_w.html">Henry W Conrad</a>, later husband to "V. P." FLORA's 1st born, Wilhelmina Isidora, married
28 November 1875. Their Post Office was Montgomery City until later 
when it and Verdigris City were combined into Liberty. The land remained
Ceded Osage Indian Territory, until September 1870. It is written that
some Indians collected $5 for farm land to $10 for timbered land from
settlers for their Ceded Territory in Verdigris (once known as
Vermillion River around 1806, according to history of Lyon County) 
River valley (lowest elevation in Kansas at 680 feet above sea level, that's
70 feet lower than mouth of the Kansas River) which empties into
Arkansas River near Fort Gibson, Indian Territory (Muskogee, OK). 
Valley was fast becoming populated with white settlers.

   <P>  FLORA and Shults family movements between 1870 and 1880 census,
leave questions unanswered. Who moved where when? Mother in-law's obit
said she moved to Montgomery County in 1871, but NO documentation is
found John & Mary moved to Lyon County. Why is wife Mary buried in
Americus Cemetery, Lyon County, Kansas?

   <P> Its most difficult to believe that John moved to remote Lyon
County, likewise most difficult to understand why Mary, who died 9
November 1874, with daughter Harriette admittedly in bed with her, is
buried with other daughter in remote Americus Cemetery. This is far 
from any known family member.

  <P>  Found in March 1875 state census, is John alone, dwelling #25,
his children with Harriett Schult's with her family, dwelling #15, and
brother Volney with all but daughter Frances at dwelling #131, at since
January 1871, new Liberty Township,Montgomery County, Kansas. Daniel
stated in his pension papers that he went to Colorado in 1875. V P's
daughter Wilhelmina married John's friend and neighbor Henry W Conrad,
28 November 1875, with V P and his family going also to Colorado.



    <P> It would appear that my grandfather William Walter FLORA's birth
of 23 November 1871 was in Montgomery County. Earlier (year 2003) I had
incorrectly assumed and thus wrote, my grandfather was born in Labette
County, This assumption was from reading John A FLORA's 1901 biography
by Nelson Case. It now appears that I was wrong, and birth occurred in
Montgomery, possibly in Lyon County, where the children's mother, my
great-grandmother, 23 y/o Mary Elizabeth (Shults) FLORA died Monday, 9
November 1874, possibly from child birth of Jennie G., but such is NOT
found documented, as yet.

  <P>Sandra Stuart GRAY, a great,great,granddaughter, on 8/12/05, shared:

  <P>"Harriette [Hattie A] often told the story of being called into her
mother's bedroom as she lay dying to kiss her goodbye. She said she was
four at the time. She climbed up on her bed to do so, and lay with her
awhile...."

   <P>  Widower John A Flora, 35 of Liberty, Kansas and widow Adda
Smith, 33, of Thayer, Kansas, obtained a marriage license in Montgomery
County, were wed by F R Morton in Parsons, Labette County Thursday, 24
October 1878, She was born in Indianapolis, Indiana 12 November 1844,
had two surviving children of three, Peter and Luma.

  <P>   John moved his family, except my grandfather William, to, what
was once known as, "White Hair's Village" (early Osage Indian Chief) on
the Neosho River, later "Little Town" in 1862 organized as "Oswego Town
Company", with first Court House built 1868, enlarged 1870, then in
1871, with a population of about 3,100, was established the second 
class
City of Oswego, Labette (formerlyDorn, then Neosho) County, Kansas.

   <P>  We found in 1870 census of Oswego Township a William E Smith,
"teamster", with "Adelia" (Addie C), son "James T" (Peter?), daughter
Lumie" (Linnie C) and "David V" (Delaney V), "Teamster" & "Jenny"
(SarahJ) Shipley with son Moses, also others, appearing as a boarding
house and in Oswego's 1880 census, D V Shipley, "laborer", "Jenice" 
wife and son "Moma" (Moses) plus others, possibly a boarding house where 
Carl Gray may have stayed during his two years in Oswego.

  <P>   We speculate; Mrs Shipley was Mrs Smith's nine year older
sister, born in Indiana. Shipley's son, Moses, is in 1900 census and
later years, at Monett, Missouri working for a railroad, most likely
"Frisco", where Carl Gray is in-charge, with family, Hattie A, two sons
and sister Ethel Davis Gray (1871AR-1910IL), who married Carl's
assistant, LeRoy Kramer, 6 June 1900, all in Monett for 1900 census.
This aquaintanceship might explain why Addie C Smith-FLORA and John
Andrew FLORA are buried in the Shipley lot at Oswego Cemetery.

  <P>   The Oswego 1880 census (year of downtown fire), has John a
"livery man" with 2nd wife "Ada" (AddieC) Smith, born Indianapolis,
Indiana, her son "Peter", born, Illinois, daughter "Luma" (Linnie C),
born, Kansas, his son Clarence and daughter Hattie A. but son William W
is found 30-miles west, at Liberty in Montgomery County with his
grandmother, Harriette Shults, and found to the north in Neosho (Dorn
till 1864) County, Reverend Henry K Muth, who married John's sister
Sarah Catherine 26 December 1856 in Indiana, now married to a Millie.

  <P>   Wm Cutler also wrote; "He entered upon the hotel business ....
spring of 1881." Case wrote; ".... he conducted the Condon Hotel 
[House] for a period of twelve years.". This fits well if his new wife had
indeed been operating a boarding house in 1870.

   One story was; Her father's 2nd marriage did not make Hattie A
the "happiest camper" in Oswego, --- so yet barely, 17, she on Monday, 
6 December 1886, at the Condon House, with Reverend Charles J Bowles, of
1st Baptist Church, married "Frisco" railroader, Carl Raymond GRAY
(1867AR-1939DC), he barely 19, who in August 1886, lost his mother,
Virginia LaFayette (Davis) GRAY. See:<a href="http://www.rootsweb.com/~arwashin/pics/grays.html">Gray</a>, ending with Carl & Harriette's story.

   <P>  The citizens of Labette County elected; John A FLORA, Register
of Deeds, 1890-1892, his step-son-in-law, <a href="http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/c3/clark_elmer_c.html"> Elmer C
Clark</a>, Clerk of the Courts, 1892-1896, & Judge in 16th Judicial District in
1908 and John's 1900 Liberty Township neighbor, James W Boggess,
Surveyor, 1890-1892. Son William, my maternal grandfather, was 
President of YMCA (Oswego) 1891 & 1892 and was actively interested his entire 
life with Walter Head, as was my paternal grandfather, Samuel Cleveland
Boggess(H717) in Carthage, Missouri(ah).

   <P>  James William Boggess (H1078) and I are common with my 5th (his
3rd) great-grandparents, Henry Boggess (C2) (1680-1727) & Mary Bennett
(1685-1743) of Saint Stephens Parish, Cherry Point, Northumberland
County, Virginia, my Robert (D7) born 1707, his Thomas (D9)1713. His
children and other Boggesses lived in Labette County.

   <P>  Son William became a dentist and was married at Carthage,
Missouri in 1892, then Clarence married his first wife in 1895 at
Cherryvale, Kansas and in 1898 Clarence married for the second time in
Independence, Kansas

  <P>  John Andrew FLORA and second wife Addie were farming in Liberty
Township, Labette County in 1900 and living in Oswego in 1910, then
after her 1913 death, he remained at 10 Michigan Street till death in
1934, near step-daughter Linnie C (Smith) with husband Elmer C Clark at
24 Michigan Street.

    <P> John passed away Sunday 4 November 1934, buried with 2nd wife
in the Shipley's plot at Oswego Cemetery.


    <P> CLARENCE MORTON FLORA (1868KS-1924OK), "....was born near Liberty, 
Kan.,
[Wednesday] April 22 1868." according to Oklahoma City's "Daily
Oklahoman" obituary, page#5, 29 November 1924. ("Liberty" didn't exist
then, ---- to be correct it was Verdigris Township, Wilson County,
Kansas with 1870 Post Office Montgomery City. After, Verdigris City &
Montgomery City were combined and its named Liberty, which was moved

   <P>     WILLIAM WALTER FLORA (1871KS-1922CO). Birth of my
grandfather was Thursday, 23 November 1871, according to Carl R Gray's,
22 June 1933 genealogical research report furnished aunt Harriette
Pearle (Flora) Hopkins, most likely born in Montgomery County, Kansas,
possibly Lyon County. William, strange to me, while rest of family are
in Oswego, is found in 1880 census with his maternal grandmother,
Harriette Catherine (Sterling) Shults (Schultz), (1870 census she's at
Elmendaro Township, Lyon County, 1860 census at Emporia Township,
Breckenridge County, 1850 census Washington Township, Franklin County,
Ohio), her obit said moved in "1871", less 2nd hubby, John Marsh, and
without "Marsh" surname, with son George E, her seventh child, and
servant Ettie Grubb, in relocated, on the railroad, Liberty, Montgomery
County, Kansas, 11-miles north of Indian Territory, since November 
1907, Oklahoma, --- property listed between household's of her sixth born
Elige (Elijah?) with wife Libbie and her first born, John with wife
Clara, --- near is her fifth born, Sarah, married to Deputy Sheriff
Clarence Scranton whom she lived with since 1885  untill her 20 August
1905 death, also near grandson, Clarence Morton FLORA's home.

  <P>"Mrs H C Shults" (grandmother Harriette Catherine) attended William's
wedding with 1877 orphaned, Maude Wallick (1870IN-1940CO), born in 
Peru, Miami County, Indiana, then of Chicago, Illinois, in Carthage, Jasper
County, Missouri Sunday, 21 August1892, perfomed by W S Knight. Also 
"Mr & Mrs.J.A. FLORA" (father & step-mother), "Mr and Mrs C.R. Gray"
(sister, Hattie A and Carl) and others from Kansas & Chicago attended.

  <P>William was a dentist in Carthage, Missouri, living at 1216 South Main
Street (old numbering), when Maude gave birth to Harriette Pearle
(1893MO-1973CO) and my mother Frances Elizabeth (1898MO-1928MO), moving
in 1900 to Colorado Springs for Maude's health. William was very active
in church, civic and sporting affairs, also an investor in the 
new(1906) Colorado Springs National Bank with friend Willis R Armstrong. He lived
long enough to enjoy seeing his daughters attend college and be married
by friend, Reverend Dr. C B Wilcox, minister of the First Methodist
church, eldest at home, 2129 North Nevada, to Dr Guy H Hopkins
(1894IL-1966CO) 8 September 1920, entire family in attendance,

  <P>William died at aunt Harriette's Pueblo, Colorado home in 1922, and
grandmother Maude died at her Colorado Springs home in 1940, both buried in 
Colorado Springs' Evergreen Cemetery, later, daughter Harriette's husband, Guy
Hopkins then Harriette, joined them.

   <P>  JENNIE G FLORA, infant who lived but one month, is buried with
mother in Americus Cemetery, Lyon, County. We have uncovered nothing 
nor is anything known about little Jennie, such as date or location of
birth, presumed to be Lyon County.

   <P>  LINNIE C (Smith) CLARK (1868KS-between1939 & 1956KS), born July
1868 in Kansas, daughter of William E Smith and Addie C Smith-FLORA, 
and step-daughter of John Andrew FLORA. Linnie, Sunday, Christmas Day 1892,

Indiana, near Leavenworth, later a Judge in Labette County. Their only
son, Elmer C Clark, Jr., was born November 1893, attending University 
of Kansas in 1911. Elmer Jr. was "Best Man" for Dr Guy H Hopkins, 8
September 1920 in Colorado Springs when marrying John A's oldest
granddaughter, Harriette Pearle FLORA (my mother's sister), daughter of
William W FLORA. I don't know the connection, likely a college friend 
to Guy Hopkins of Grand Junction, Colorado, born 1894, Alton, Illinois,
graduated from Colorado College, then attending Washington University
Medical School in Saint Louis. Hopkins' daughter (11/22/05) is unaware
of father's best man.

  <P>John FLORA lived near them from at least 1910. Carl Raymond Gray, her
step-brother-in-law, included Linnie C Clark in his 1939 will, but she
is not mentioned in Harriette's 1956 will.

   <P>  PETER (James T?) W SMITH, born about 1867, son of William E
Smith and Addie C Smith-FLORA, step-son of John Andrew FLORA, is said

County, Missouri with a son, Earl.

   <P>  John and Mary FLORA's seven grandchildren are buried; Colorado,
Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Wisconsin. There were
fifteen great, grandchildren and thirty great,great,grandchildren and
unknown number of great,great,great,grandchildren.




  <P><b>CONCLUSION:</b>


    <P> Life was kind and generous in many ways to the christian,
pioneering FLORA family from Germany to Pennsylvania into Indiana, then
Kansas and beyond. Some found Montgomery and/or Labette County, Kansas
prairie was often difficult! Individuals, so living, faced many
challenges from Indians, from murderous gangs of train and bank robbers,
to prairie fires, to weather, to loneliness. Life was at times very
harsh in early Kansas, on their "bed of roses", --- finding many a thorn
to draw blood of those who pioneered, making them better for their
untiring efforts against odds many lesser individuals ran from. Each
pioneering survivor should be respected for their accomplishments such
as John Andrew & Mary Elizabeth FLORA, his brothers, their families and
their three children born and raised on this Kansas' prairie, formerly
Osage Indian Territory, during period the Ingall's were there; <a href="http://littlehouseonprairie.com/">: Clarence Morton</a>, owner of Flora Shirt Company, Oklahoma City with Stella having two sons, Harriette
Amanda, "American Mother of 1937" and first women with nationwide radio
coverage of her Bible Class, who with Carl had three sons, two in "Who's
Who in America", and William Walter, a dentist and successful investor,
with Maude, lived long enough to see his two daughters married in his
Colorado Springs home, youngest, my mother Frances, the year before his
1922 death.     (11/30/05)
