      <p align="left">The US Youth Soccer Southern Regional Championships has 
        concluded, crowning 12 teams that will represent Region III at the US 
        Youth Soccer National Championships, July 26-31, at Disney's Wide World 
        of Sports Complex in Orlando, FL. The top team from each region will meet 
        to determine the National Champion. </p>
      <p>In addition to six teams from North Texas and three from North Carolina, 
        two teams from Oklahoma and a team from Georgia will advance to the National 
        Championships in four weeks. </p>
      <p>Of the three remaining champions from 2004, only Solar 89 SC (TX N) would 
        earn a chance to return trip to the National Championship. The scoreboard 
        remained empty through regulation and overtime to bring Solar and 88 CASL 
        Elite (NC) to midfield to take kicks from the mark to determine who would 
        advance as the Under-16 boys champion. These teams met as Under-14 at 
        the regional finals in North Carolina where CASL defeated Solar in kicks 
        and went on to win the National Championship. Last year, Solar lost in 
        the final of the National Championships. Through five the score was knotted 
        at three with a miss and a save for each side. </p>
      <p>Going into sudden death both sides scored on their first three kicks 
        and that's when Joshua Mikulewicz (TX) who hadn't allowed a goal all week 
        made a save on Adam Williams (NC) to give Solar's Miles Kruzich center 
        stage. Kruzich fired past a leaping Jarrett Davis (NC) to give Solar the 
        win (7:6) and another shot at the Under-16 D.J. Niotis Cup awarded to 
        the National Champion. </p>
      <p>In the Under-16 Girls final, Hurricane Futbol Club of Oklahoma met the 
        Greensboro Twisters Green of North Carolina. The Hurricane's knocked off 
        last year's regional champions (Dallas Texans 89 Red) in kicks to advance 
        while Greensboro defeated GSA 89 Phoenix Red. Entering the championship 
        Greensboro had only 13 players and considered a change in their playing 
        strategy to conserve energy. </p>
      <p>&quot;We tried to play it safe and we lost our first game of the week 
        so we shelved that and just played our style and things worked out great 
        for us,&quot; said Chris Brewer, head coach. &quot;We actually lost another 
        player to injury on Monday so we were down to 12. These girls had tremendous 
        heart and character all week and particularly today.&quot;</p>
      <p>Greensboro's Maria Lubrano scored in the 26th and 33rd minutes to give 
        her side the two-point advantage. In the 78th Katherine Richardson found 
        the back of the net for the Hurricanes who made a charge late but time 
        expired and Greensboro is headed to Disney. </p>
      <p>The one-time National and four-time Regional Champion, Atlanta Fire United 
        (Under-19 Boys) advanced over CESA 85 Premier (SC) 2:1 on goals by Chad 
        Chambers (32:00) and Tomek Charowski (43:00). Massoud Roushandel, Head 
        Coach said, &Ograve;this team has been together for ten years and this 
        is a culmination of ten years of hard work, I am very proud of these guys.&Oacute; 
      </p>

        Teams Still In Contention</font></b></p>

      <p align="left">The four teams hailing from Maryland posted a record of 

        1-0-3 on the day, while the two defending National Champions split their 

        games. The defending champion Atlanta Concorde Fire of the Boys Under-17 

        division are now winless in round-robin play and are all but finished 

        with their title defense. <br>

        <br>

        Georgia's other regional champons split their games. The Tophat 07 Gold 

        lost their U14 girls game with Slammers FC (CA-S) 3-0, while U19 Peachtree 

        City Lazers downed Kolping Ben-Gals (OH-S) 2-1 on <b>Kristen Rhyne's</b> 

        two goals.<br>

        <br>

        North Carolina's two teams in nationals, also split games. The CASL Elite 

        boys topped Crossfire-James (WA) 4-1 on goals by <b>Watson Williams</b>, 

        an own goal and two by <b>Brett King</b>. The U17 Greensboro Twisters 

        Green dropped their second game in the tournament, falling 1-0 to the 

        Sereno '86 Golden Eagles (AZ).<br>

        <br>

        In the Girls Under-16 division, the Bethesda Excel hosted the Eclipse 

        Select in the primetime match. In front of more than 1,275 local fans, 

        the Excel topped the Eclipse 3-1. The Excel opened scoring at the 13-minute 

        mark. Play appeared to be moving away from the Eclipse net when a header 

        brought the ball back towards the 18-yard mark. <b>Brittany Tegeler</b> 

        got her foot on the ball, placing it past the Eclipse goalkeeper to take 

        the early lead. <br>

        <br>

        <b>Amanda Poach</b> made it 2-0 for the Excel in the 21st minute. The 

        Eclipse got on the board in the 39th minute when <b>Stephanie Zare</b> 

        headed a cross to the far post. Tegeler struck again in the 75th minute, 

        receiving a through ball inside 18 yards and pushing a toe-poke past the 

        opposing keeper. <br>

        <br>

        Earlier in the day, the Bethesda Dragons took on the Dallas Texans Red 

        85 at 8:00 a.m. in the Girls Under-18 division. Both teams came out strong 

        in spite of the early hour. In the first half the Dragons pressured the 

        Texans, controlling possession throughout. The Texans goalkeeper, <b>Stephanie 

        Connors</b>, kept the game scoreless with stellar play in the net. <br>

        The game remained scoreless for most of the second half until the Texans' 

        <b>Amy Berend</b> broke the ice in the 82nd minute. In the 85th minute, 

        <b>Zoe Bouchelle</b> chipped a floater from 22 yards out past Connors, 

        netting the equalizer to salvage a point for the home team. <br>

        <br>

        Maryland's Casa Mia Bays battled the Irvine Strikers in the Boys Under-15 

        class. Following the lead set by the Dragons, Casa Mia played to a 2-2 

        draw. Irvine opened up the scoring with a goal from Nelson Rios in the 

        25th minute. Casa Mia tied the match with a shot from Matt Beckman in 

        the 65th minute. Irvine regained the lead when Robert Garcia netted one 

        in the 70th. Stephen Romeo scored the final goal in injury time to level 

        the score for the Casa Mias. <br>

        <br>

        Casa Mia Head Coach Stephen Nichols hoped his team would fall back into 

        their normal playing style before its final preliminary match on Friday. 

      </p>

      <p>&quot; Sixty out of the 80 minutes we played a great game. The tie is 

        unacceptable to me. Giving away two goals in uncharacteristic of us,&quot; 

        said Nichols. &quot;There were a lot of missed opportunities, we will 

        make adjustments for the next time we play.&quot; <br>

        The Baltimore Bays and Sereno 86 Golden Eagles of the Boys Under-17 group 

        played to a scoreless draw. Further action in the same division saw the 

        Chicago Magic SC hand defending National Champions, the Concorde Fire 

        their second loss of the tournament. With a final score of 4-1, Chicago 

        opened up scoring in the 3rd minute and never looked back. <br>

        Although suffering a 3-2 loss in their first match, defending National 

        Champions FC Delco Arsenal remained hopeful to repeat, posting a 5-2 win 

        over the Edmond SC Royals in the Boys Under-19 group. FC Delco's offense 

        dominated the match, boasting five goals from as many players, spanning 

        from the 23rd to 89th minute of the match. After two early goals from 

        the FC Delco, the ESC Royals tied the game at two-a-piece in the 57th 

        minute. Delco came back with three unanswered goals to close out the game. 

        <br>

        Depsite earning three points on the day, FC Delco Head Coach Alan Mezger 

        will continue to examine the team's play. &quot;Our defense usually carries 

        us, for some reason offense is carrying us. The defense has played together 

        for 3 to 4 years, today they looked like strangers to each other. We will 

        address this hopefully in the next two games.&quot; <br>

        Youth soccer's ultimate prize is at stake this with 48 teams from 39 clubs 

        and 19 states squaring off in six boys and girls age brackets, Under-14 

        through Under-19. Round-robin play for the SNICKERS&reg; US Youth Soccer 

        National Championships, being held for the second year in a row at the 

        Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown, Md., continues Thursday, July 24th 

        and Friday, July 25th. National Champions will be crowned following games 

        on Sunday, July 27th. </p>

        Teams Lead The Way In Nationals </font></b></p>

      <p align="left">The four teams hailing from Maryland posted a record of 

        2-1-1 on the first day of the 2003 SNICKERS&reg; US Youth Soccer National 

        Championships at the Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown, MD, while the 

        two defending National Champions suffered losses.<br>

        <br>

        The Casa Mia Bays of the Boys Under-15 division shutout the Dallas Texans 

        Red 88 by a score of 2-0. The Texans netted an own goal in the 21st minute 

        before Casa Mia's <b>Stephen Romeo</b> tallied another in injury time. 

        The Bethesda Excel played to a 1-1 draw against the San Diego Surf in 

        the Girls Under-16 class. The Surf took control of the game early with 

        a goal from <b>Leigh Ann Robinson</b> in the 18th minute. Bethesda's <b>Amanda 

        Poach</b> answered to tie the game in the 56th minute. <br>

        <br>

        The Bethesda Dragons, of the Girls Under-18 group, have a challenge ahead 

        of them after dropping their first match to the Tsunami Sota (Minn.) by 

        a score of 2-1. <b>Caroline Smith</b> tallied both goals early for Tsunami 

        Sota in the 7th and 15th minutes. <b>Melissa Hornfeck</b> netted the lone-goal 

        for Bethesda in the 22nd minute.<br>

        <br>

        The Baltimore Bays hosted the marquee match of the day against defending 

        National Champions, the Concorde Fire (GA) in the Boys Under-17 class. 

        <b>Patrick Healey</b> gave Baltimore a 1-0 lead in the 18th minute, dribbling 

        through traffic and chipping the ball over the opposing goalkeeper. Play 

        was suspended in the 55th minute due to severe weather. <br>

        <br>

        Following an almost 90-minute delay, play resumed. In the 59th minute, 

        Healey struck again, this time, on a header from 6 yards out with the 

        assist to <b>Eric Frey</b>. Less than one minute later, <b>Tomasz Charowski</b> 

        put the Concorde Fire on the board, on a restart from 15 yards away. In 

        the 75th minute <b>Nick Stowe</b> evened the scored on another header 

        with the assist going to<b> Ryan Kell</b>. The game's deciding tally was 

        knotched in the 88th minute on a break away goal by Baltimore's <b>Matthew 

        Curran</b>.<br>

        <br>

        The FC Delco Arsenal, the only other defending National Champion to return 

        to defend their title, suffered a 3-2 loss to the Sockers FC Chicago in 

        the Boys Under-19 group. FC Delco matched each of Chicago's goals, almost 

        playing to a draw before Chicago's Adam Ruud scored the gaem-winner in 

        injury time.</p>

      <p align="center"><b><font size="4" color="#000080"><a name="brazilbeatsus"></a>Brazil 

        Beats U.S. U20s In Title Match</font></b></p>

      L'ALCUDIA, Spain Tavares scored early to send a slightly older Brazil to 

      a 1-0 victory over the United States under-20 men in the championship match 

      of the C.O.T.I.F XIX Torneig Internaciona. 

      <p>A sloppy giveaway by the U.S. in its defensive end allowed Edno to find 

        Tavares free in the area. The striker went in alone on Steve Cronin and 

        slotted the ball under the sliding American goalkeeper. For the first 

        time in this tournament, the U.S. had conceded the opening goal of a match. 

      </p>

      <p>The U.S. men opened the tournament with a 2-1 loss to Brazil before winning 

        consecutive matches over Italy, Ukraine and Uruguay to advance to tonight's 

        final. Brazil finished the tournament undefeated in five matches. </p>

      <p>Cronin, who made three saves tonight, was named the tournament's top 

        goalkeeper. His biggest test came in the 43rd minute when he stoned Brazilian 

        striker Marcelo in a one-on-one. </p>

      <p>&quot;I thought we played well in the second half tonight, but you can't 

        expect to beat Brazil if you only play one half&quot;, said U.S. coach 

        Thomas Rongen. &quot;This tournament was a very positive experience for 

        this team, and I think we learned a lot that will help us when the (CONCACAF 

        world championship) qualifying tournament comes around in November.&quot; 

      </p>

      <p>The first half was a stagnant one, as both teams showed the wear and 

        tear of playing five international matches in six days. The U.S. outshot 

        the Brazilians 5-4 in the half, but Brazilian goalkeeper Diego made four 

        saves to keep the Americans off the board. </p>

      <p>Striker Mike Magee, who scored four goals in his only other start of 

        the tournament, started tonight in place of suspended captain Devin Barclay 

        who was suspended for accumulating three yellow cards in earlier matches. 

        Magee had the best American chance in the first half, slipping behind 

        the defense to get to Eddie Johnson's flick but goalkeeper Diego slid 

        out to block Magee's shot. </p>

      <p>Johnson nearly equalized in the 65th minute, but his flashing header 

        from a corner kick from midfielder Justin Mapp was somehow pushed just 

        wide by Diego. </p>

      <p>Brazil committed twice as many fouls as the Americans, 24-12, and had 

        six players receive yellow cards, three in stoppage time of the 80-minute 

        match. </p>

      <p>This tournament was the final match preparation for the U.S. before World 

        Youth Championship qualifying at Blackbaud Stadium in Charleston, S.C., 

        from November 13-17. The top two teams from the four-team round robin 

        qualify for the 2003 world under-20 tournament in the United Arab Emirates 

        from March 25-April 16. </p>

      <p>Notes: The U.S. scored 11 goals in the tournament, the most of any team. 

        Tbe U.S., playing a man down for the second time in the tournament, defeated 

        previously unbeatn and unscored upon Uruguay 5-2 in the semifinals. In 

        group play the U.S. rallied from a 1-0 deficit to beat Italy 2-1 on goals 

        by Johnson and Barclay, and routed Ukraine 5-2 behind Magee's four goals. 

      </p>

      <p>When these two teams met in the opening game of the tournament, U.S. 

        midfielder Ricardo Clark (Furman) received two yellow cards and was sent 

        off in the 34th minute, leaving the Americans with 10 men for the remaining 

        46 minutes. </p>

        Under-20s Held In Charleston</font></b></p>

      Blackbaud Stadium in Charleston, S.C., will serve as the venue for half 

      of CONCACAF qualifying for the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship. The tournament 

      November 13-17 marks being hosted by U.S. Soccer will be staged in Charleston, 

      S.C., at Blackbaud Stadium from November 13-17, 2002. <br>

      <br>

      This tournament marks the first time since 1980 that the United States has 

      hosted the under-20 men's world championships. In April of 2001, the U.S. 

      Soccer Federation played host to the CONCACAF Under-17 qualifying tournament 

      in St. Louis with the Americans advancing to the world tournament for a 

      ninth consecutive time. 

      <p>In November, the four-nation Group B qualifying tournament will include 

        the U.S.. Canada, the second-place team from Central America and the winner 

        of a playoff between the Caribbean Group B and Group C winners. A round 

        robin format will be used with each country playing the others once. The 

        top two finishers advance to World Youth Championship in the United Arab 

        Emirates which runs from March 25 to April 16 in 2003. </p>

      <p>CONCACAF, the confederation for North America, Central America and the 

        Caribbean, will hold another qualifying tournament in Panama from October 

        16-20. </p>

      <p>&quot;We've been training and preparing for this event for almost a year 

        now and I think this team is ready for the challenge ahead of us,&quot; 

        said U.S. under-20 coach Thomas Rongen. &quot;We have a nice mix of college 

        and professional players, and I think Blackbaud Stadium and the fans there 

        will help us reach our goal of qualifying for next year's world championship.&quot; 

      </p>

      <p>The U.S. under-20 men have posted a 10-5-9 record in 2002, scoring nearly 

        twice as many goals (39-20) as a variety of competition, including full 

        internationals and club opponents. The final roster will not be released 

        until the tournament approaches, but numerous Major League Soccer players 

        -- those born Janaurya 1, 1983 or after -- are eligible. Among them are 

        including strikers Santino Quaranta (D.C. United), Eddie Johnson (Dallas 

        Burn) and Devin Barclay (San Jose Earthquakes), and midfielders Craig 

        Capano (Chicago Fire), Bobby Convey (D.C. United), Justin Mapp (D.C. United), 

        Santino Miguel Saavedra (Chicago) and Jordan Stone (Dallas Burn). <br>

      <p>The Atlanta Fire capturned the Under 16 boys national title Sunday at

      the SNICKERS® US Youth Soccer National<br>

      Championships (SNICKERS® Cupat the Maryland SoccerPlex in Germantown, MD,

      with a 2-1 win over FC Delco Dynamo II from Downingtown, PA. It was the

      Atlanta team’s first national championship</p>

      <p>Joe Howie gave the Fire a first-half lead with a goal in the 39<sup>th</sup>

      minute. Domenick Raimo tied the score with FC Delco Dynamo II’s only

      goal of the game 13 minutes into the second half. The game-winner was

      scored by Jonathan Leathers in the 76<sup>th</sup> minute.</p>

      <p>In the Under-19 boys final, Texans 82/83 (Houston) won its second<br>

      consecutive title by handling Far West champion Blast SC (San Bernardino,

      Calif.), 4-1, to win the James P. McGuire Cup. The McGuire Cup has been

      awarded annually to the Under-19 champion since 1935, except during World

      War II.</p>

      <p align="left">The Atlanta Fire and Texans 82/83 were the only Region III

      championship teams.<br>

      <br>

      The Far West Regional (Region IV) teams cornered the gold market, winning

      eight of 12 age-group titles at the Maryland SoccerPlex.<br>

      <br>

      Sizable crowds throughout the day saw Far West teams dominate the girls

      division, sweeping all six age groups, and adding two boys titles.<br>

      California-South accounted for six of the Far West champions, with<br>

      California-North and Colorado teams winning one title apiece.<br>

      <br>

      The San Diego Surf Under-19 girls won their second national championship

      in three years, avenging last year's loss to the Michigan Hawks in the

      Under-18 final with a 7-2 romp in the rematch. San Diego also won the

      Under-17 crown in 2000.<br>

      <br>

      Far West girls teams also swept the titles when there were four age groups

      (Under-16 through Under-19) in 1996 and 2000.<br>

      <br>

      The Rochester (N.Y.) Jr. Rhinos Elite, the youth arm of the A-League<br>

      Rochester Rhinos, claimed New York West's first national championship,

      1-0, over the Aiken (S.C.) Fire in the Under-15 boys final.<br>

      <br>

      Like the Texans club, two FC Delco (Downingtown, Pa.) boys teams split

      their finals. The Under-18 Arsenal swamped Texans 83/84, 5-1, to win the

      club's sixth US Youth Soccer national championship. FC Delco Dynamo II

      fell short of a second straight national title, losing to the Atlanta

      Fire, 2-1, in the Under-16 boys final.<br>

      <br>

      Region I (East) and the Southern region (Region III) each won two

      age-group titles.<br>

      Day At Maryland Soccer Plex</font></b></p>

      <p>Minnesota and New York West are two state associations with little or

      no history at the SNICKERS® US Youth Soccer National Championships. But

      two teams are on their way to&nbsp;changing that as the second day of

      group play was completed Thursday at the&nbsp;<br>

      Maryland SoccerPlex.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The Tsunami Sota (Minneapolis) Under-17 girls and Rochester (N.Y.) Jr.&nbsp;Rhinos

      Elite Under-15 boys are two of the tournament's most intriguing - and&nbsp;potent

      - teams thus far. Both have scored a tournament-best eight goals&nbsp;while

      going 2-0 and are in strong position to advance to championship finals&nbsp;Sunday.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The 48 boys and girls teams in age groups Under-14 through Under-19 will&nbsp;complete

      round-robin play Friday. The top two teams in each age group as&nbsp;determined

      by points qualify for the finals. Teams earn three points for a&nbsp;win,

      one for a draw and zero for a loss.</p>

      <p>Tsunami, the first Minnesota girls team to play at the national&nbsp;<br>

      championships since 1991, feature the event's most prolific goal scorer.&nbsp;<br>

      Caroline Peterson, a Kansas recruit, knocked home three goals for the

      second&nbsp;day in a row, leading Tsunami to a 4-2 win over the HBC Fury

      (Huntington,&nbsp;N.Y.).&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The Jr. Rhinos, the first New York West team to win a Region I title and&nbsp;qualify

      for the national championships, slipped past the winless Palos&nbsp;Verdes

      (Calif.) Raiders, 2-1. Chris Nacca scored the go-ahead goal in the&nbsp;36th

      minute for the Jr. Rhinos (2-0).&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The <b>GSA 85 Phoenix Red</b> form Georgia dropped their first game in the

      national tournament, falling to the Pleasanton Rage from California 2-0 in

      the Under-17 girls division.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The home-favorite <b>Bethesda Fury</b> will have to battle to defend its

      national&nbsp;title after a 1-0 loss to the Colorado Girls Soccer Academy

      (Littleton). The&nbsp;Fury, last year's Under-17 national champion, meets

      group leader <b>Atlanta FC&nbsp;Lightning '84 White</b> on Friday. Atlanta

      FC posted its second win with a 4-2&nbsp;win over Busch SC (St. Louis),

      which fell to 0-2.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Bethesda's club mates split their matches. <b>The Eclipse Under-14 girls</b>&nbsp;<br>

      stopped the <b>Atlanta FC Lightning '88 White</b>, 3-0, to improve to 1-1,

      while&nbsp;the <b>Alliance Under-17 boys</b> fell to 0-1-1 after a 2-1

      loss to the Irvine (Calif.) Strikers.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The Strikers (2-0) cliniched a berth in Sunday's championship final with

      the&nbsp;victory.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Both FC Delco teams in the field won to remain undefeated. The Arsenal&nbsp;Under-18

      boys (2-0) will play Sunday thanks to a 4-1 thumping of winless NFC&nbsp;Vincere

      (Omaha, Neb.). The Texans 83/84 Red (Houston) and Classic FC&nbsp;Bandidos

      (Albuquerque) played a scoreless match, leaving the Texans with&nbsp;four

      points and the Bandidos with one.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Jerry Yirenki's goal in the 64th minute gave Delco's Dynamo II Under-16

      boys&nbsp;a 1-0 win over the Sereno '86 Golden Eagles (Phoenix). Dynamo II

      is tied&nbsp;with the <b>Atlanta Fire</b>, a 3-1 winner over the Michigan

      Wolves (Midland), for&nbsp;first place with four points. Sereno and the

      Wolves have one point each.&nbsp;<br>

      &nbsp;<br>

      Other highlights included:&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-19 boys - Both games ended 3-3, putting last year's Under-18

      national&nbsp;champion, Texans 82/83 (Houston), atop the table with four

      points. Former&nbsp;national champions Stony Brook (N.Y.) Panthers and

      Chicago Magic SC have two&nbsp;points apiece, and Blast SC (San

      Bernardino, Calif.) has one point courtesy&nbsp;of its draw with the

      Magic.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-19 girls - The San Diego Surf are in position to play in a national&nbsp;<br>

      final for the third year in a row, coming from behind to knock off

      Challenge&nbsp;82/83 (Spring, Texas), 2-1. Kim Castellanos scored her

      third goal in two days for the Surf. Nicole Bregar also has three goals

      after notching both&nbsp;goals in the Michigan Hawks' 2-0 win over the HBC

      Magic.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-15 boys - The <b>Aiken Fire</b>, the first boys team from South

      Carolina to&nbsp;reach the national championships, rebounded from a 6-2

      loss to Rochester&nbsp;with a 3-1 victory over Sockers FC Chicago, putting

      both teams at 1-1. <b>Eric&nbsp;Baffour</b> scored two goals for Aiken.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-15 girls - <b>Chantilly (Va.) Milan</b> needs a win Friday to

      advance to a&nbsp;second consecutive national final. The 2001 Under-14

      runner-up fell to Sting&nbsp;'87 (Dallas), 1-0. Chantilly meets group

      leader Laguna Hills (Calif.)&nbsp;Eclipse, which has four points after a

      scoreless match with the Windy City&nbsp;Pride (Chicago), the Pride's

      second 0-0 result. Sting '87 is second with three points, followed by

      Windy City (two) and Chantilly (one).&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-14 boys - The <b>Maryland SC 88 Bays</b> (Baltimore) tripped the La

      Jolla&nbsp;(Calif.) Nomads, 1-0, on <b>Brandon Fischer's</b> goal in the

      41st minute to move&nbsp;to 2-0. Kirk Quavas scored two goals to boost the

      Chicago Magic SC past the&nbsp;<b>IAYMCA Eagles</b> (Alpharetta, Ga.),

      4-0. The Magic and Nomads each have three&nbsp;points, while the Eagles

      are 0-2.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Cal-South girls - Three California-South girls teams - the Surf, Under-16&nbsp;West

      Valley Samba (Northridge) and Under-14 Slammers FC (Newport Beach) -&nbsp;are

      2-0. The Samba dominated Challenge 85/86, 3-0, as Tracy Lansing scored&nbsp;her

      fourth goal. West Valley has eight consecutive shutouts including Far&nbsp;West

      Regional play. Slammers slipped past Team Chicago, 2-1, on goals by&nbsp;Alexis

      Mielke and Alexa Orand.&nbsp;<br>

      National Championships Get Underway</font></b></p>

      <p>GERMANTOWN, Md. (July 24, 2002) - It was an uneven performance for past&nbsp;champions

      during the opening day of the SNICKERS® US Youth Soccer National&nbsp;Championships

      (SNICKERS® Cup) at the Maryland SoccerPlex.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Eight teams with national titles to their credit finished the first round

      of&nbsp;<br>

      group play 3-2-3, including a pair of match-ups between past champions in&nbsp;the

      Under-19 boys and girls divisions.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The 48 boys and girls teams in age groups Under-14 through Under-19 began&nbsp;round-robin

      play, which runs through Friday. The top two teams in each age&nbsp;group

      as determined by points advance to the national championship finals&nbsp;Sunday.

      Teams earn three points for a win, one for a draw and zero for a loss.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Both match-ups of past winners were reprises of national finals. The San&nbsp;Diego

      Surf took a measure of revenge for its loss to the Michigan Hawks in&nbsp;last

      year's Under-18 girls final by clipping the Midwest Regional champions,&nbsp;4-1.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Last year's Under-17 girls champion, the Bethesda (Md.) Fury, looked

      strong&nbsp;with a 4-0 win over Busch SC (St. Louis) in Under-18 play.

      After a scoreless&nbsp;first half, the four-time Region I champions pulled

      away as <b>Ali Wean</b> scored&nbsp;goals in the 55th, 56th and 60th

      minutes and <b>Noelle Keselica</b> added another&nbsp;three minutes later.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      </p>

      <p>Three other players scored three goals each to tie Wean for the

      tournament scoring lead.&nbsp; <b>Caroline Smith</b> recorded a hat trick

      for&nbsp;<br>

      the Tsunami Sota (Minneapolis) in their 4-3 win over last year's Under-16&nbsp;girls

      champion, GSA '85 Phoenix Red (Lilburn, Ga.). <b>Brian Usinger</b> scored

      all&nbsp;of his goals in the first half to boost the Rochester (N.Y.) Jr.

      Rhinos&nbsp;Elite past the Aiken (S.C.) Fire, 6-2, in Under-15 boys

      action. <b>Tracy&nbsp;Lansing</b> knocked home her goals in the second

      half for the West Valley Samba&nbsp;(Northridge, Calif.) Under-16 girls in

      their 4-0 win over Busch SC.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Atlanta FC coach <b>Brian Moore</b> had a successful day, leading the

      Under-14&nbsp;Lightning '88 White to a 3-0 win over Team Chicago followed

      with a 1-0 win&nbsp;for the Under-18 Lightning '84 White over the Colorado

      Girls Soccer Academy&nbsp;(Littleton).&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      A repeat of the 2000 Under-17 boys title match between the champion Stony&nbsp;Brook

      (N.Y.) Panthers and Chicago Magic resulted in a 1-1 tie. The Magic won&nbsp;the

      Under-16 title in 1999.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The third champion in the Under-19 boys group, the Texans 82/83 (Houston),&nbsp;quieted

      Blast SC (San Bernardino, Calif.), 2-0, for a positive start to&nbsp;their

      quest for back-to-back titles.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      In Under-16 boys action, the 2001 Under-15 national champion FC Delco

      Dynamo&nbsp;II (Downingtown, Pa.) and Michigan Wolves (Midland) also tied,

      1-1. <b>Peter&nbsp;Sokolski</b> scored in the final minute to draw FC

      Delco even, seven minutes&nbsp;after <b>Jacob Peterson</b> had put

      Michigan ahead. &nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      The two girls teams representing HBC (Huntington, N.Y.) opened their

      second&nbsp;consecutive visits to the national championships with shutout

      wins. The&nbsp;Under-19 HBC Magic dumped Challenge 82/83 (Spring, Texas),

      1-0, and the&nbsp;Under-17 HBC Fury stopped the Pleasanton (Calif.) Rage,

      2-0.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Other highlights included:&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-18 boys - FC Delco Arsenal (Downingtown, Pa.) closed down the

      Classic&nbsp;FC Bandidos (Albuquerque, N.M.), who are making their second

      consecutive&nbsp;appearance, 2-0.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-17 boys - The Irvine (Calif.) Strikers started their second trip to&nbsp;<br>

      the national championships with a 3-2 win over another returning team from&nbsp;2001,

      Dallas Texans '85 Red. Irvine bounced back from a 2-0 deficit to&nbsp;reverse

      last year's 3-0 round-robin loss to the Texans.&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-16 boys - The Atlanta Fire, also making a second straight

      appearance,&nbsp;erased a 2-0 deficit in the second half to earn a 2-2

      draw with the Sereno&nbsp;'86 Golden Eagles (Phoenix).&nbsp;<br>

      <br>

      Under-15 boys - <b>Mike Bradley</b>, son of MLS Chicago Fire coach <b>Bob

      Bradley</b>,&nbsp;scored twice for Sockers FC Chicago in its 3-1 win over

      <p align="center"><b><font size="4" color="#000080"><a name="u19women"></a>U-19 

        Women Qualify For World Championship</font></b></p>

      <p>Two questions remained after CONCACAF qualifying for the first 

        ever Under-19 Women’s World Championship. Who can beat the 

        United States team, and did the U.S. run up the score against 

        Costa Rica?</p>

      <p>Coach <b>Tracey Leone</b>’s U.S. women romped through three 

        qualifying games, beating Suriname, Haiti and Costa Rica by 

        a combined 34-1 score. However, some probably left the game 

        feeling that the U.S. has poured it on a bit.</p>

      <p>The berth in the World Championship came on a 14-1 pasting 

        of Costa Rica before 4,000 at Dwight Yorke Stadium in Bacolet, 

        Trinidad &amp; Tobago. </p>

      <p>&quot;It was a peak performance that reflected all the great 

        things about American women's soccer,&quot; said Leone apparently 

        failing to grasp that her team’s need to score six times in 

        the second half -- once in injury time -- exhibited extremely 

        poor sportsmanship. &quot;Great preparation, great passion 

        and mental toughness, great togetherness and a beautiful possession, 

        attacking and exciting style of soccer with great goals for 

        the fans.&quot; </p>

      <p>The U.S. won Group B with a 3-0 record and will join Mexico, 

        the Group A winner, as the representatives of the region of 

        North America, Central America and the Caribbean in the 12-nation 

        world tournament in Canada in August. Mexico romped over Trinidad 

        &amp; Tobago 5-1 to earn advancement. </p>

      <p>The Americans did not allow a shot in their first two wins, 

        and gave up the only game in the tournament after the score 

        was 8-0.. While the U.S. could rationalize routing Suriname 

        15-0 in its first match, saying goal differential was all important 

        because it would break any ties in the standings, no such excuse 

        could be used against Costa Rica. All the U.S. needed against 

        Costa Rica was a tie to advance to the world championships. 

      </p>

      <p>And, of course, the thought of the U.S. needing the benefit 

        of goal differential in a tournament where it won by an average 

        of 11 goals per match and permitted a total of two shots on 

        goal in three games is ridiculous. The Americans were simply 

        piling it on a defenseless opponent in Suriname. </p>

      <p>After two matches where the U.S. outshot its opponents 85-0, 

        44 of those attempts going on frame, 16-year old goalkeeper 

        <b>Ashlyn</b> <b>Harris</b> finally had to face a shot. And 

        one got by her. </p>

      <p>In this match, the U.S. piled up a 38-5 advantage in shots, 

        27-2 on goal. If there was any worry the Costa Ricans were 

        about to stage a comeback after <b> Martha</b> <b>Chavez</b>’s 

        goal in the 58th minute, the U.S. quickly responded with tallies 

        by <b>Kelly Wilson</b> in the 59th and <b>Megan Kakadelas</b> 

        in the 60th. </p>

      <p>The next four goals were pure hubris, particularly the final 

        one, coming off a free kick by Allison Graham in stoppage time. 

        The sporting thing to do? Miss by a mile. </p>

      <p>&quot;We wanted to close out this amazing trip in style and 

        with a great performance,&quot; said <b>Heather O'Reilly</b> 

        who had four goals and three assists. &quot;To end on one of 

        our best performances ever is a great feeling. We didn't want 

        Costa Rica to think they had a chance of taking our spot in 

        the World Cup and we finished awesomely tonight.&quot;</p>

      <p>Wilson also had four goals, three coming in the second half, 

        giving her 10 for the tournament, three more than teammates 

        O’Reilly and <b>Lindsay Tarpley</b> who had seven apiece. </p>

      <p>&quot;Over the past year and half, the team has put in a tremendous 

        amount of commitment and sacrificed a lot of things to be in 

        the position the play in a World Cup,&quot; said Tarpley, the 

        U.S. captain. &quot;We feel like we've come to the end of a 

        wonderful and successful long journey and now we are ready 

        to start another one. We're are going to be very excited to 

        show the world what we can do in Canada.&quot;</p>

      <p>The truth of the matter is American participation in the world 

        championships was pre-ordained. Every participant in CONCACAF 

        qualifying, including Mexico which the U.S. did not have to 

        play, was dwarfed by the size of the American talent pool and 

        the resources put into assembling and training the team. </p>

    Team Boca Gunners from Boca Raton, FL. Jackson FC will represent Region III and

    Mississippi as the U19 Region III champion. It is interesting to note that all four of the

    consecutive national championship appearance and won the under-17 title in 1998. </p>

    <p>The Colorado Rush's under-18 girls and the Chicago Magic Sockers under-17 boys are

    seeking back-to-back titles, while the Weston (Conn.) Wild Thing under-18 girls claimed

    Of Albert</a> Medina, 20, Will Be Realized<br>

    With Growth Of Ozarks Soccer<br>

    </font>By Rob Kerby</strong></p>

    <p>(Sunday, November 28, 1999) -- On Tuesday, at a factory in Harrison, Ark., a bolt came

    undone, a bracket snapped and a large piece of equipment fell onto a 20-year-old soccer

    player. He was crushed under its weight. And now I sit thinking about <b>Albert</b> <b>Medina</b>'s

    legacy. </p>

    <p>Sincere and focused as a high school player, the boy slept through referee class. His

    miserable test scores and worse re-test scores prompted us to begin what has become an

    institution around here, mandatory referee tutoring for kids. We try to make it fun for

    those who think they want to ref. We want them poised on the edge of their chairs, ready

    to impress the visiting instructors that they know the dimensions of a field and the five

    things a goalkeeper can't do unless they want to have to defend themselves against an

    indirect free kick. </p>

    <p>Because of Albert, just yesterday, we instructed seven 11- and 12-year-old referee

    candidates on restarts, then drove to a local church where a junior high youth group was

    taught a few secrets of 3-v.-3 soccer. We then rode with the church kids to a youth center

    in Harrison where everybody climbed and rappelled down an artificial mountain and swung on

    a trapeze-like contraption called a &quot;barn swing&quot; and bowled with a frozen turkey

    -- and had a great time. </p>

    <p>Our guys loved it. But quietly, they all wanted to talk about Albert. </p>

    <p>He was a member of the first-ever Green Forest High School soccer team, a squad that

    beat everybody in northwest Arkansas just a few short years ago, astonishing our area,

    raising immense hopes in town that we might take a state championship -- and inspiring a

    lot of folks that the impossible could happen here. </p>

    <p>Albert's was a ragtag team at best. Three girls, including my oldest daughter. Several

    delinquents, including one that is serving time in prison today. The goalkeeper was an

    assimilated Hispanic boy with a carefully developed Arkansas drawl who hated for anybody

    to know that he had been born in Mexico. The coach worked at the local poultry plant under

    an assumed name since he had slipped into the United States illegally. </p>

    <p>Albert was the team captain. He was a tall, muscular junior whose main talent was

    tenacity. He never gave up. Never. </p>

    <p>Well, if his heart wasn't in something, he didn't try. Referee class is a prime

    example. He attended out of respect for me -- because I wanted him to go. But paying

    attention was too much. Sitting around talking about soccer was beyond his comprehension.

    Soccer is to be played. Soccer is to be lived. And who wants to be an &quot;arbitro&quot;

    -- a referee -- anyway? Come on, coach, can't we just play? </p>

    <p>Albert's services were Friday at Nelson's Funeral Chapel in Green Forest, Ark. We cut

    short Thanksgiving plans with family in Tulsa to return for the funeral. </p>

    <p>Albert's was the first soccer team in our area that successfully mixed local longtime

    residents' kids with the newcomer Hispanics -- and demonstrated that truly superb soccer

    can be played on uneven hayfields. His was the first soccer team that got the attention of

    the local newspaper and radio station -- when they caught the vision that a bunch of

    country kids in T-shirts emblazoned with &quot;Gary's Backhoe Service&quot; could play

    this newfangled game darn well against the big-city yuppies in their fancy Umbros. </p>

    <p>Albert was certain we would take the Arkansas State Scholastic Cup. But in Little Rock,

    we were humbled. The whole weekend was physical. It was rough. Our girls were battered and

    bruised and crying on the bench. Our macho boys were furious and dishing it back -- only

    they didn't know how to get away with it -- so they were getting the cautions while the

    real culprits were snickering behind the referees' backs. </p>

    <p>A livid and determined Albert took it upon himself to win this thing single-handedly

    out of sheer teen-age will. He went down so many times in hard tackles that we lost count.

    We'd carry him off the field, ice him down, then he'd demand to rejoin the fray. Somewhere

    he'd picked up a favorite pair of aluminum shin guards. They'd been padded once upon a

    time, but had deteriorated down to bare metal and straps. They had to be worn over a pair

    of socks and under a second pair. But he attached special significance to these weird shin

    guards. He wore them no matter what. </p>

    <p>As he pulled them off on the sidelines, I was astonished that they were bent and

    distorted. He twisted them back into shape. Suddenly, I understood what was going on out

    there. He went back in -- only to go down again. Then again. And again. The final time, he

    was so disoriented that the referee ordered him -- forcefully -- off of the field.

    Protesting, the high schooler retreated to the bench where he nursed his wounds and

    demanded to return. We sent him back in. </p>

    <p>We lost. And he wept. Private, bitter tears of disappointment. He had been so sure of

    victory. He had dreamed of holding high the State Cup. He had talked of playing in front

    of a cheering stadium. He had worried about whether he could look good on TV, talking to

    the news media. I had tried to explain that even if we did win, there would be no stadium

    and certainly no clamoring press. </p>

    <p>He just smiled. He knew that glory was just around the corner. Albert was a leader. A

    dreamer.</p>

    <p>We weren't equipped yet to provide him what he deserved. But because of Albert, we

    began taking the next group just younger than him to tryouts for northwest Arkansas'

    premier squad, the Arkansas Comets. Because that worked, and because of Albert, we saw

    there was a need for our own program, The Quest, which actually beats the Comets upon

    occasion. </p>

    <p>But it all came too late for Albert. He didn't go to college. He never got to play in

    that stadium with the press waiting to quiz him under TV lights. </p>

    <p>Because of Albert, two weeks ago, we took six kids to the State Select tryouts. We're

    holding our breath -- believing that maybe this will be the year that one of our kids

    makes the Olympic Development Program. </p>

    <p>Albert helped prove so many things. A team could be fielded mixing our two cultures.

    Our little town would accept a team coached by poultry plant workers who spoke little

    English. Good soccer could be played in the middle of nowhere. But now it will go on

    without Albert. </p>

    <p>He was airlifted to the big hospital in Springfield, Mo. There, he fought tenaciously,

    as was his way. But his body had been crushed. I am told that he fought long and hard on

    the operating table -- refusing to give up. In the end, Albert was carried off the field

    -- protesting furiously, I am sure. Arguing until the end. </p>

    <p>We will miss Albert Medina terribly. His legacy continues. Someday a kid is going to

    walk onto the soccer field at the Olympics from the rural Ozarks. Eventually, a northern

    Arkansas player from Alpena Pass or Green Forest or Eureka Springs is going to show up in

    the World Cup. And long before that, local kids are going to go to college on soccer

    scholarships.</p>

    <p>They will be the legacy of Albert Medina. A kid who deserved a chance - a kid who hated

    to give up. </p>

    slot. Thus, should some brackets be comprised of less than 12 teams the pairings will

    change.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Final groupings for each age group will not be known until all

    state cup competitions have been completed in the spring.</p>

    <p class="MsoNormal">Over the years, the boys brackets have seldom had any openings, while

    there have been some changes in the girls brackets.</p>
