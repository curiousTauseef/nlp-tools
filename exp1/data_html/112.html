Both were issued a horse and rigging. Active duty shown as, 9 October to 29 October 1864, between Coldwater Grove (13-miles south of Aubrey) and Fort Scott, KS. They were involved with defeat of General Sterling Price's Missouri &amp; Kansas campaign noted, 13 November 1864 entry of Virginia Davis GRAY'S, diary,  published in 1983 &quot;Arkansas Historical Quarterly&quot;. They were attached, at Coldwater Grove, to Colonel Thomas Moonlight's, 2nd Brigade of Major General Blunt's Provisional Cavalry Division. This 2nd brigade included the 11th Kansas Cavalry, Moonlight's Regiment., 2 Companies of 5th Kansas Cavalry, 2 Companies of 16th Kansas Cavalry, a battery of howitzers and the 11th Regiment Cavalry, Kansas State Militia (under Colonel A.J. Mitchell). with assignment to go to Fort Scott, along the Ft Leavenworth to Ft Scott, 1859 road (generally, present day route #7) from Paola. They engaged General Price's 12-mile caravan, saving Mound City, 6:00 am, 25 October 1864 while &quot;Mine Creek&quot; engagement occurred later (11:30 am, 25 October1864) in Linn county, KS. They continued towards Fort Scott, again engaged at 2:30 pm at Little Osage River,  near Fort Lincoln, with Price continuing out of state at Deerfield,  Missouri, 10:30 pm and on &quot;56-miles&quot; to my home town of Carthage Missouri(ah) which had earlier been burnt down, for forage at Spring River. The  three FLORA brothers were each battling in Linn county, Kansas, 24-26 October 1864! No pension was found for John Andrew.

We hope the same for his brothers elsewhere.<br><br>Back to John's first wife, Mary Elizabeth Shults, was fourth known child of Elijah Shultz (1824OH-1860KS) and Harriet Catherine Sterling (1824NY-1905KS), whom Carl Gray traced as great,granddaughter of Colonel Heinrich Staring (1730-1818) of Tryon county New York's Militia during Revolutionary War, and Shultz family with seven children, possibly other family members (see Elmendaro township, Lyon county 1870 census), left Washington township, Franklin county, Ohio settling in Emporia township, Breckenridge (Lyon, 6 February1862) county, Kansas Territory 1859. Harriet, widowed, 26 September 1860 while pregnant with their eighth child, Henry. Elijah, most likely buried in Cottonwood cemetery. She married widower John &quot;March&quot; (Marsh), 18 November 1868, is found in1870 census of Elmendaro township, Lyon county, Kansas (P O Neosho Rapids), with kids and relatives split in neighboring households. Strange is fact; Marsh, nor marriage is never found mentioned again, her name returned to Shults.<br><br>Brother Daniel Rice Boon FLORA &amp; wife Mary lived next to John &amp; Mary Elizabeth in 1870 census, while the county's population exploded from a few white settlers in 1867 to 7,564, growing rapidly to 13,017  in 1875, 18,213 in 1880 and 36,252 in 2000. D R B FLORA with neighbors, Conrads, also noted in historical writings being in area in 1868.<br><br>The Ingall's of now famous &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot; fame, http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Prairie/1867/indpic.html settled just west, on Diminished Reserves of Osage Indians remaining about a year, where little Carrie Ingall was born August 1870.<br><br>During those early years, amongst the many other hardships, were: 130 Kansas settlers slaughtered by Indians in 1867, a horrendous  prairie fire occurred in 1868 when the night sky was said to be bright enough to read a book 1-mile away but, as pioneers. The FLORA families survived most hardships of early prairie living, then John may have returned to Lyon county for awhile, back to Montgomery then to Labette, Daniel to Colorado Territory. Wolney's daughter married in Montgomery county and stayed. John's mother-in-law, Harriett Shults raised his kids until  John got settled after Mary's death and with her children's families are in Montgomery county 1880 census, since 1871 with my grandfather William FLORA in her household since three y/o to early manhood (1885?).<br><br>Following five excerpts found in Cutler's 1883 writings, http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/montgomery/montgomery-co-p1.html , flavor conditions found when John &amp; Mary FLORA settled to raise their family.<br><br>&quot;[ALSO]- About six miles south of where Independence now stands, on the west [right] bank of the Verdigris River, was the site of [Indian Village] Big Hill, or Gov. Joe's village. [across river from first Liberty town]&quot;<br><br>&quot;Although numerous settlements had already been made, yet it was not until 1869, that the resistless march of emigration first crossed the Verdigris River to occupy and possess the &quot;promised land&quot; that lay beyond.<br><br>&quot;The Government agency was located near the mouth of Drum Creek [Dunlap's store &amp; Montgomery City later nearby before moving to Independence in 1872], on its north side, and was held by... in 1868 by Maj. I. N. Gibson, a Quaker gentleman, who was held in high esteem by both the whites and Indians. This general respect he retained throughout the adjustment of the serious difficulties between the races in 1869 and 1870, occasioned by the unauthorized attempts of settlers [such as the Ingall's] to trespass upon and occupy these lands, the rightful property of the Indian.&quot;<br><br>&quot;No improvements of importance had yet been made, so that up to 1869 there were but few [including two FLORA families] and scattered evidences of anything except Indian occupancy. In the midst of such surroundings of uncivilized life, the hardy pioneer of Montgomery County had come to make his home, enduring the trials, braving the dangers, expecting the rewards. In order that a settler should obtain and occupy a &quot;squatter's claim,&quot; at this time he was obliged to secure consent  from the Indians, which was easily done by paying them a few dollars in money.&quot;<br><br>&quot;During the winter of 1869, the banks of the Verdigris [river] were alive with camps and campers. Families spent the winter, living in covered wagons or in huts constructed of hay.&quot;<br><br>ALSO NOTE: http://skyways.lib.ks.us/counties/MG/ (Kansas: a Cyclopedia Of State History by Frank Blackmar (1912).)<br><br>&quot;An election for county officers and to locate the county seat was held in November of the same year [1869]. The returns from Drum Creek were thrown out on technical grounds, and the remaining vote gave a majority for Liberty. ....<br><br>&quot;They [a new board] selected Independence as the county seat and, finding it useless to dissent, the old board gave up the fight. At a hotly contested election in Nov., 1870, Independence received the largest number of votes and became the permanent county seat.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The organization of county government was followed by reckless and extravagant bond issues. Before 1872 the people had for various purposes voted a debt upon themselves to the amount of nearly $1,000, 000.&quot;<br><br>&quot;On the 11th of September [six days before Harriette FLORA's birth in 1869], the founders of the town [Independence, Kansas] and their friends thought to initiate the place, marking the event as historic by a  season of rejoicing. The feast consisted of roast ox, a whole barrel of bread, and four kegs of beer. The party brought these items from Oswego by wagon and ox-team, with J.N. Debrule as teamster.&quot; http://www.indkschamber.org/independence_history.html<br><br>&quot;Legend has it that Independence [Kansas], in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, had more millionaires per capita than any place else in the United states. Standing as testimony to that legend are the stately mansions still scattered throughout the city.&quot; http://www.lasr.net/pages/city.php?City_ID=KS0611012<br><br>The above debt, Montgomery county's political unrest and 1873/4 national financial crisis or 1874 &quot;grasshopper infestation&quot; are all possible reasons why John and Mary FLORA may have (?) returned to Lyon county (if in-deed they did ?), some 100-miles northerly. My guess, after1873, when the Kansa Indians had been moved, likely summer of 1873 or '74. Date of 1873 allows FLORA's five years required by Homestead Act, to improve their claimed land for ownership, but in the mean time, son Clarence Morton was born 22 April 1868, then Harriette Amanda (Hattie A) 17 September 1869 (said by Wm Cutler, to be &quot;..first white child born in Montgomery county.&quot; so what about Clarence's birth, when it was Wilson county), then William Walter, 23 November 1871), lastly (?) where was Jennie G born, living 1-month, whose birth may  have caused Mary's, 9 November 1874 death.<br><br>The ninth Federal census in 1870 of Verdigris township (Liberty, January 1871), Montgomery (1864 till 3 June 1869, Wilson) county, Kansas lists John with wife Mary E., son C M, 2, daughterH O, 9/12m, and two farm hands, R Marsh (?possibly, wife's step-brother), dwelling #188, family #187 located between household's of brother  Daniel with wife Mary, dwelling #187, family #186 and dwelling #189, family #188, being Hendrix (Capt J H ) Conrad, &lt;http://www.kancoll.org/books/cutler/montgomery/montgomery-co-p17.html (Conrad)&gt; who also attended, in 1856, Hartsville University, Bartholomew county, Indiana and mined in Nevada, 1859-1863, has a son, Hoarce Greely (Harriette's age) &amp; brother Henry W Conrad, http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/c3/conrad_henry_w.html later husband to &quot;V. P.&quot; FLORA's 1st born, Wilhelmina Isidora, married 28 November 1875. Their Post Office was Montgomery City until later when it and Verdigris City were combined into &quot;Old&quot; Liberty. The land remained Ceded Osage Indian Territory, until September 1870. It is written that some Indians collected $5 for farm land to $10 for timbered land from settlers for their Ceded Territory in Verdigris (once known as Vermillion River around 1806, according to history of Lyon county) River valley (lowest elevation in Kansas at 680 feet above sea level, that's 70 feet lower than mouth of the Kansas River) which empties into Arkansas River near Fort Gibson, Indian Territory (Muskogee, OK). Valley was fast becoming populated  with white settlers.<br><br>FLORA and Shults family movements between 1870 and 1880 census, leave questions unanswered. Who moved where when? Mother in-law's obit said she moved to Montgomery county in 1871, but no documentation can  be found for John &amp; Mary's move to Lyon county. Why is wife Mary buried in Americus Cemetery, Lyon county, Kansas? True widow Harriet with Mary, was household #79 Americus township in State census nine years earlier, but remarried in 1868 living in Elmendaro township in 1870, then Montgomery county 1871.<br><br>Its most difficult to believe John moved to remote Lyon County, likewise to understand why Mary, who died 9 November 1874, with daughter Harriette, admittedly in bed with her, is buried with other daughter in remote Americus Cemetery, far from any known family member. Something  is missing in this equation??<br><br>Found in March 1875 state census, is John, dwelling #25, alone, his children with Harriet Shults' and her family, dwelling #14, and brother Wolney with all but daughter Frances who is cited as a School Dist. #22 honor student (reported in the Emporia News, June 4, 1875, p. 3, col. 4), living with grandparents in Lyon county, at dwelling #131, in, since January 1871, Liberty (formerly Verdigris) township, Montgomery county, Kansas. Daniel wrote, he moved to Colorado in 1875. V P's daughter, Wilhelmina, married John's college friend and neighbor Henry W Conrad, 28 November 1875, with V P and his family going also to Colorado territory.<br><br> Also found in 1875, household #95, was Charles Henry Boggess, (H1080), brother to James Willliam Boggess, (H1079) later found in Labette county's 1900 census, both common with me at my 5th (their 3rd) great,grandparents, Henry Boggess, (C2) (1680-1727) &amp; Mary Bennett (1685-1743) of Saint Stephens Parish, Cherry Point, Northumberland county, Virginia, my Robert (D7),1797, his Thomas (D9) 1713. He moved  on and died in Ponca City, OK 1925.<br><br>It appears my grandfather's, William Walter FLORA, birth, 23 November 1871, was in Montgomery county. Year 2003, I had incorrectly assumed and wrote, he was born in Labette county, Assumption was from reading John A FLORA's 1901 biography by Nelson Case. It now appears I was wrong, and birth occurred in Montgomery, possibly in Lyon county, where the children's mother, my great-grandmother, 23 y/o Mary Elizabeth (Shults) FLORA died Monday, 9 November 1874, possibly from child birth of Jennie G., but such is NOT found documented, as yet.<br><br>Sandra Stuart GRAY, a great,great,granddaughter, on 8/12/05, shared:<br><br>&quot;Harriette [Hattie A] often told the story of being called into her mother's bedroom as she lay dying to kiss her goodbye. She said she was four at the time. She climbed up on her bed to do so, and lay with her awhile....&quot;<br><br>Widower John A Flora, 35 of Liberty, Kansas and widow Adda (Crawford) Smith, 33, of Thayer, Kansas, obtained a marriage license in Montgomery county, were wed by F R Morton in Parsons, Labette county Thursday, 24 October 1878, She was born on a farm near Clayton, Indiana 12 November 1843/4, had two surviving children of three, Peter and  Luma.<br><br> John moved his family, except my grandfather William, to what was once known as, &quot;White Hair's Village&quot; (early Osage Indian Chief) on the Neosho River, later &quot;Little Town&quot; in 1862 organized as &quot;Oswego Town Company&quot;, with first Court House built 1868, enlarged 1870, then in 1871, with a population of about 3,100 (2000 population, 22,835), was established the second class City of Oswego, Labette (formerlyDorn, then Neosho) county, Kansas.<br><br> We found in 1870 census of Oswego township a William E Smith, &quot;teamster&quot;, with &quot;Adelia&quot; (Addie C?), son &quot;James T&quot; (Peter?), daughter Lumie&quot; (Linnie C?) and &quot;David V&quot; (Delaney V?), &quot;Teamster&quot; &amp; &quot;Jenny&quot; (SarahJ?) Shipley with son Monie, also others, at their Star Hotel, --- in Oswego's 1880 census, D V Shipley, &quot;laborer&quot;, &quot;Jenice&quot; wife and son &quot;Moma&quot; (Monie) plus others.<br><br> Mrs (Crawford) Shipley was Mrs (Crawford) Smith's nine year older sister, born in Indiana. Shipley's son, Monie, is in 1900 census and later years, at Monett, Missouri working as a conductor for &quot;Frisco&quot;, where Carl Gray is in-charge, with family, Hattie A, two sons and sister Ethel Davis Gray (1871AR-1910IL), who married Carl's assistant, LeRoy Kramer, 6 June 1900, all in Monett for 1900 census. This aquaintanceship might explain why Addie C Smith-FLORA and John Andrew FLORA are buried in the Shipley lot at Oswego cemetery.<br><br>The Oswego 1880 census (year of downtown fire), has John a &quot;livery man&quot; with 2nd wife &quot;Ada&quot; (AddieC) Smith, born Indianapolis, Indiana, her son &quot;Peter&quot;, born, Illinois, daughter &quot;Luma&quot; (Linnie C), born, Kansas, his son Clarence and daughter Hattie A. but son William W is being raised 30-miles west &quot;until young manhood&quot;, at Liberty, Montgomery county by his grandmother, Harriet Shults, and found to the north in Neosho (Dorn till1864) county, Reverend Henry K Muth, who married John's sister Sarah Catherine 26 December 1856, who died 21 December 1877, Centropolis, Franklin county, Kansas, now married to a Millie.<br><br> Wm Cutler also wrote; &quot;He entered upon the hotel business .... spring of 1881.&quot; Case wrote; &quot;.... he conducted the Condon Hotel  [House] for a period of twelve years.&quot;. This fits well if his new wife who had been operating te Star Hotel in 1870.<br><br>  One story was; Her father's 2nd marriage did not make Hattie A the &quot;happiest camper&quot; in Oswego, so yet barely, 17, she on Monday,  6 December 1886, at the Condon House, with Reverend Charles J Bowles, of 1st Baptist Church (before departing the area), married &quot;Frisco&quot; railroader, Carl Raymond GRAY (1867AR-1939DC), he barely 19, who in August 1886, lost his mother, Virginia LaFayette (Davis) GRAY, and 1885, a boarder at Condon House. See: http://www.rootsweb.com/~arwashin/pics/grays.html, ending with Carl &amp; Harriette's story.<br><br>The citizens of Labette county elected; John A FLORA, Register of Deeds, 1890-1892, his step-son-in-law, Elmer Clark, http://skyways.lib.ks.us/genweb/archives/1912/c3/clark_elmer_c.html,<br>Clerk of the Courts, 1892-1896, &amp; Judge in 16th Judicial District in 1908 and John's 1900 Liberty township neighbor, James W Boggess, Surveyor, 1890-1892. Son William (&quot;Will&quot;), my maternal grandfather, was President of YMCA (Oswego) 1891 &amp; 1892 and was actively interested his entire life with Walter Head, as was my paternal grandfather, Samuel Cleveland Boggess  in Carthage, Missouri.    James William Boggess, brother to Charles Henry Boggess, found in Montgomery county in 1875, and I are common with my 5th (his 3rd) great-grandparents, Henry Boggess (1680-1727) &amp; Mary Bennett (1685-1743) of Saint Stephens Parish, Cherry Point, Northumberland county, Virginia, my Robert born 1707, his Thomas 1713. His children and other Boggesses lived in Labette county.<br><br>Clarence's first wife died 6 August 1892, and William married her cousin at Carthage, Missouri, 21 August 1892.  Clarence married a second wife in 1895 at Cherryvale, Kansas and in 1898 married for the third time in Independence, Kansas.<br><br>John Andrew FLORA and second wife Addie were farming at Liberty township, Labette county, where her brother Frank Crawford was, in 1900, living in Oswego in 1910, then after her 1913 death, John remained at 10 Michigan Street till death in 1934, near step-daughter Linnie C (Smith) with husband Judge Elmer C Clark at 24 Michigan Street.<br><br>John passed away Sunday 4 November 1934, buried with 2nd wife in the Shipley's plot at Oswego cemetery, northwest of town.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></blockquote>
